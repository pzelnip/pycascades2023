## Python Syntactic Sugar

<https://2023.pycascades.com/program/talks/pythons-syntactic-sugar/>

Brett Cannon

What is Syntactic Sugar?

Distill down what are the fundamental bits of Python

List comp with locals)()

11 pieces you can't live without

1. Integers
2. function calls
3. while
4. try/except
   1. all other parts are optional (ex else, finally)
5. def
6. return
7. yield
8. Assignment
9. global
10. nonlocal
11. del

"A Turing machine with Python flourishes"

Simple unraveling

83 pieces of syntax to get rid of, 4 examples to give a flavour

Attribute acccess (x.y)

language spec can make things interesting, decorator example

Special (magic, dunder) methods, negate example

Binary operators

## Implementing Distributed Tracing

<https://2023.pycascades.com/program/talks/implementing-distributed-tracing/>

Zach Lipp

<https://lippingoff.netlify.app/talks/pycascades_2023>

traces vs spans, traces are made up of spans, tags/attributes record info about spans, no schemas

opentelemetry client (used to be opentracing)

have to manually propagate headers

Pros/cons slide is great

## SBOMs Are Coming. How will Python help?

Anthony Harrison

Pre-recorded talk

SBOMs = Software Bill Of Materials

We no longer undersand how our software is constructed or works
Iceberg analogy

SBOM - formal set of machine readable metadata describing your software application
SBOMs are designed to be shared within and across organizations
Important part ofa  software risk strategy

OpenSSF SBOM
Timeline slide, really accentuates how fast this is developing (log4j was only 1.5 years ago)

TWo standards and formats:

* <https://spdx.org>
* <https://cylconedx.org>

SBOMs used throughout the software lifecycle

Tooling

* sbom4files
* sbom4python
* distro2sbom

Discussion of shorcomings of the tools.

Not entirely clear how SBOMs are used

Challenges with consistency in package metadata (license example)

SBOM mgmt tools:

* sbom-manager
* sbomdiff
* sbomaudit

Typical Use cases

* does my project use version x of component y
* others...

SBOM Governance

* cve-bin-tool
* sbom2doc

CTA to improve the data used for SBOMs

Remote ddev extension, can pick from templates

Example use case of using devcontainer.json for reproducing a bug

Example use case of education (helping with setup in teaching envs)

## Metaprogramming in Python using Metaclasses

Adarsh Divakaran & Aby M Joseph

<https://2023.pycascades.com/program/talks/metaprogramming-in-python-using-metaclasses/>

"Code that can modify code"

metaprogramming for classes is called metaclasses

decorator examples

* method decorators
* class decorators
  * singleton example

Descriptors

* readonly attribute example

Dunder methods

Class Creation Steps in Python

"type is the default metaclass in Python"

* type(obj)
* type(name, bases, attrs)

2nd is useful for creating classes dynamically :mindblown:

since classes are just objects, metaclasses are the way to customize their creation
the base metaclass is type
type's type is type

A metaclass is a class whose instance is another class.

Steps to write a metaclass

1. write a subclass of type
2. insert hw new metaclass into the class creation process


Modify class heirarchies - use metaclasses

Proposals for new things to avoid metclasses

`__init_subclass__` - called when a subclass is created

ABC as an example of metclasses
Enums as an example of metaclasses
Django models as an example of metclasses (Model uses ModelBase as it's metaclass)

* DCL

Some slides of using the built-in sqlite3 module.

Some discussion of querying mechanics, how indexes can help.

## Practicality Beats Purity: The Zen of Pythonâ€™s Escape Hatch?

Christopher Neugebauer

<https://2023.pycascades.com/program/talks/practicality-beats-purity-the-zen-of-pythons-escape-hatch/>

Discussion of zen of python

"Not prescriptive and a terrible way to settle arguments"

Decorators as an example that's contradictory to Zen of Python (explicit is better than implicit)

type hints as example of contradicting the "Simple is better than complex"

Python is not prescriptive, it is opinionated

One use cas'es simplicity is anothyer use case's complexity

## Cloud Infrastructure From Python Code: How Far Could We Go?

Asher Sterkin

<https://2023.pycascades.com/program/talks/cloud-infrastructure-from-python-code-how-far-could-we-go/>

Virtual presentation

Slides - <https://www.slideshare.net/AsherSterkin/pycascades23pdf>

is ifc same as iac?  No

CDKs - don't solve the core prooblem anew but rather wrap the same low level
abstractions in a programming language

Solution: Raise the level, bridge the gap

PyIFC - seems to be this idea of generating CDK type stuff from python code?

Example that took a python app, and seemed to produce a cloudformation template

## Untangle Python Spaghettis - Deep Dive Into Environments and Dependencies Management

Cheuk Ting Ho

<https://2023.pycascades.com/program/talks/untangle-python-spaghettis-deep-dive-into-environments-and-dependencies-management/>

<https://cheuk.dev>

Deep dive into environments and dependencies management

Why venvs?

* avoid conflicts
* preserve versions
* discard when not needed

Where are your packages stored?

How Python finds your packages?

* import statement
* searches for both python code and extension modules
* search along `sys.path`

Example creating a venv using `-m venv`

looking into the contents of a venv directory

```python
import sys
print(sys.path)
```

Discussion of how the scripts in bin modify sys.path

`pip list` to show all packages installed.  Look into `site-packages`

Conda

Data scientists are often different as they often use conda rather than pip &
such.  Lets look at what's different.

* comes with Anaconda
* environment manager that
* doubles as a package manager

Using Conda

* Similar mechanics but
* live by default in the envs folder of your conda directory
* independent from venv
* work on system level
* works with other languages as well
